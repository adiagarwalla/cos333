<p><B>Elevator Speech</B><br>
Currently, the online learning space is saturated with static resources that are not personalized to your specific problem and are non-humanized in their approach. None of them solve the simple problem that almost every online learner faces: What do I do if I do not understand something and need help? They are instead designed to allow the already familiar learner with materials with which one can continue to teach oneself. However, no one focuses on trying to answer the specific question that an actual learner faces in a personalized humanized way and that too promptly. Therefore, what is required is a humanization of the online learning space and this is where Qurious comes in.

<p> We are a real time peer to peer voice and video platform that connects your questions to real life experts in their respective fields. This way you as the learner get prompt and personalized answers to your questions. And all of this, with just a click on your iPhone

<P><b>How to access Project</b><br>
How to access or create a running version of your system.
If your system is web-based, this should be a URL.
If your system is stand-alone on some public or private machine, we
need to be able to access it on that machine.  
If your system is a phone application,
this should reference an installable version.
Don't forget passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them.
